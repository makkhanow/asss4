Task 4 – Shortest Path from Edinburgh to Dundee

Road network edges:

Edinburgh -- Glasgow = 70
Edinburgh -- Stirling = 50
Edinburgh -- Perth = 100
Glasgow -- Stirling = 50
Stirling -- Perth = 40
Perth -- Dundee = 60

Algorithm used: Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.

Start node: Edinburgh
Destination node: Dundee

Initial distances:

Edinburgh = 0
Glasgow = infinity
        Stirling = infinity
Perth = infinity
        Dundee = infinity

Step 1: Visit Edinburgh

From Edinburgh:
To Glasgow = 0 + 70 = 70
To Stirling = 0 + 50 = 50
To Perth = 0 + 100 = 100

Updated distances:
Edinburgh = 0
Stirling = 50
Glasgow = 70
Perth = 100
Dundee = infinity

Step 2: Visit Stirling because it has the smallest distance, 50.

From Stirling:
To Glasgow = 50 + 50 = 100.
Current Glasgow distance is 70, so no update.

        To Perth = 50 + 40 = 90.
Current Perth distance is 100, so update Perth to 90.

Updated distances:
Edinburgh = 0
Stirling = 50
Glasgow = 70
Perth = 90
Dundee = infinity

Step 3: Visit Glasgow because it has the next smallest distance, 70.

From Glasgow:
To Stirling = 70 + 50 = 120.
Current Stirling distance is 50, so no update.

No useful update from Glasgow.

        Step 4: Visit Perth because it has the next smallest distance, 90.

From Perth:
To Dundee = 90 + 60 = 150.
Update Dundee to 150.

Final shortest distance to Dundee = 150.

Shortest path:
Edinburgh -> Stirling -> Perth -> Dundee

Total distance:
        50 + 40 + 60 = 150
