Task 2 – Breadth First Search Trace

Graph adjacency lists:
A: C B D
B: A C E G
C: A B D
D: C A
E: G F B
F: G E
G: F B

Source node: A

BFS uses a queue and visits all nearest neighbors first.

Detailed trace:

Start at A.
Visit A.
Queue: [A]

Remove A from queue.
A neighbors: C, B, D.
        Visit C, B, and D.
        Queue: [C, B, D]

Remove C from queue.
C neighbors: A, B, D.
All are already visited.
Queue: [B, D]

Remove B from queue.
B neighbors: A, C, E, G.
A and C are already visited.
Visit E and G.
Queue: [D, E, G]

Remove D from queue.
D neighbors: C, A.
All are already visited.
Queue: [E, G]

Remove E from queue.
E neighbors: G, F, B.
G and B are already visited.
Visit F.
Queue: [G, F]

Remove G from queue.
G neighbors: F, B.
Both are already visited.
Queue: [F]

Remove F from queue.
F neighbors: G, E.
Both are already visited.
Queue: []

BFS is complete.

BFS visiting order:
A -> C -> B -> D -> E -> G -> F
